      There was once a <span id="adjective1"></span> man from a <span id="adjective2"></span> town outside of Los Angeles.  He liked to take <span id="noun1"></span>s and <span id="adverb1"></span> run them through a <span id="adjective3"></span> <span id="noun2"></span> until their <span id="bodyPart1"></span>s started to <span id="verb1"></span>.  He kept doing this until one day a <span id="adjective4"></span> <span id="noun3"></span> appeared out of nowhere and <span id="adverb2"></span> told him that he had to stop or his <span id="bodyPart2"></span>s would soon be covered in <span id="smallNoun"></span> and the pain would be so bad that he would have no choice but to throw himself off of a <span id="adjective5"></span> <span id="noun4"></span>.  He did not listen, so it happened.  This is where our story ends.
